# Notifications and alerting
It is possible to receive `notifications` via email or directly on the platform interface triggered by events such as entity `creation`, `modification` or `deletion`.

## Triggers
Each user can create their own triggers.
A platform administrator can create and manage triggers for a user, who will remain the `trigger administrator`, as well as for a group or an organization. Users belonging to this group or organization will then have `read-only` access rights on this trigger.
The user can use filters to ensure that the created triggers are as accurate as possible.

## Digest
A digest allows triggering the sending of notifications based on `multiple triggers` over a given period.
