# Users and Role Based Access Control

## Introduction

In OpenCTI, the RBAC system not only related to what users can do or cannot do in the platform (aka. `Capabilities`) but also to the system of [data segregation](segregation.md). Also, platform behaviour such as default home dashboards, default triggers and digests as well as default hidden menus or entities can be defined across groups and organizations.
